# A website as a Tribute to Dr. Borlaugh, a project form freecodecamp.org
A website, coded in my own style together with some framworks, based off the user-stories and text from here: https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page/
It's not based on codecapms tutorials, but rather on Pluralsight HTML & CSS paths.
